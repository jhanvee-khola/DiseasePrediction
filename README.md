## Local Set-Up
* It is recommended to set up the project inside a virtual environment to keep the dependencies separated
    * [Python](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#why-the-need-for-virtual-environments)
    * [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

* Activate your virtual environment.
* Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Start up the server by running ```python ./run.py```
* Visit localhost opened to explore and test
